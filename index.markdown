<p>I'm an old timey web developer, building hand crafted websites on the shores of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salish_Sea">Salish Sea</a>. In my spare time I like to try ridiculous things like building house(s) and fixing sailboats. If you have a web project you'd like to talk about, please visit me over at <a href="https://squadcar.ca">Squadcar Web & Creative</a>, otherwise feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:hello@gavincoulson.ca">email.</a></p>
